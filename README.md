# 1) StereoCameraCalibration
MonocularCameraCalibration/StereoCameraCalibration/StereoCameraRectification

1、Class "MonocularCameraCalibration" provides the implementation of 'A Flexible New Technique for Camera Calibration' by Zhengyou Zhang, and makes some improvements on intrinsic matrix analysis.

2、Class "StereoCameraRectification" is implemented according to Bouguet's method.

3、Hand-eye Calibration
